# dualis-notifier
Sends a discord-notification when ever new grades are available on ```dualis.dhbw.de``` (module grades only). This script runs periodically via a cronjob (e.g. every 5 minutes), saving current grades as a .csv everytime they change. It is designed to be as simple and easy to understand as possible.

## current deployment
At the moment the script runs on a Standard B1s Azure-Instance.

## TODO
- [ ] containerize
- [ ] aggregate data from multiple accounts (to cover retaken exams)
- [ ] handle changed grades (apparently if the grade of a single person is changed, the dhbw unpublishes and republishes everyoneâ€™s grades for that module)
